        <p>From Detroit, Michigan, to Macon, Georgia, many of America's once-proud cities have
        suffered waves of depopulation and flight to the suburbs, leaving behind empty homes and
        crumbling streets.</p>
        
        <p> Unblight – a national unconference on blight – will bring together community advocates,
        technologists, journalists, policymakers and students interested to exchange ideas and share         lessons about combating blight and repurposing abandoned parts of our communities.</p>
